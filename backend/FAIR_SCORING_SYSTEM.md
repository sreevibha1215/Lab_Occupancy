# Fair Lab Reservation Scoring System

## Overview

The new scoring system **eliminates biases** and **prevents gaming** by focusing on **optimal capacity utilization** rather than participant count or purpose labels alone.

## üéØ Core Principles

1. **Capacity Match is King** (50/100 points)
   - Best score when participants ‚âà 85-100% of capacity
   - NOT "more participants = higher score"
   - Penalizes wasteful use (<30% capacity)
   - Penalizes overbooking (>105% capacity)

2. **Proof Over Claims** (25/100 points)
   - Purpose labels (exam, emergency) mean NOTHING without proof
   - Requires verification for academic purposes
   - Analyzes description quality, not keywords

3. **Real Urgency Only** (15/100 points)
   - Based on event proximity, not just urgency claims
   - Checks if urgency label matches description content
   - Penalizes "urgent" claims without context

4. **Fair Usage** (10/100 points)
   - Tracks user history (cancellations, misuse)
   - Penalizes pattern of overbooking or under-utilizing

## üìä Scoring Breakdown

### Total Score = 100 Points

| Component | Weight | What It Measures |
|-----------|--------|------------------|
| **Capacity Match** | 50 pts | How well participants match lab capacity |
| **Authenticity & Verification** | 25 pts | Proof provided, description details |
| **Timing & Urgency** | 15 pts | Real urgency based on event date |
| **Fairness & Past Usage** | 10 pts | User behavior history |

## üî¢ Capacity Scoring (50 points)

Uses **Gaussian curve** centered at optimal utilization:

```
Utilization Ratio = num_participants / lab_capacity

Scoring:
- 85-100% capacity ‚Üí 50 points (OPTIMAL)
- 70-84% capacity ‚Üí 40-49 points (Good)
- 50-69% capacity ‚Üí 30-39 points (Acceptable)
- 30-49% capacity ‚Üí 15-29 points (Poor)
- <30% capacity ‚Üí <15 points (Wasteful - penalized)
- 100-105% capacity ‚Üí 35-42 points (Slight overbook - penalized)
- 105-120% capacity ‚Üí 10-20 points (Heavy penalty)
- >120% capacity ‚Üí AUTO-REJECT
```

### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Perfect Match**
- Lab capacity: 50
- Participants: 45 (90%)
- **Capacity Score: 50/50 ‚úÖ**

**Scenario 2: Wasteful**
- Lab capacity: 100
- Participants: 15 (15%)
- **Capacity Score: ~8/50 ‚ùå** (Choose smaller lab!)

**Scenario 3: Gaming Attempt**
- Lab capacity: 40
- Participants: 80 (200%)
- **Result: AUTO-REJECTED ‚ùå**

## üîê Authenticity Scoring (25 points)

**NOT based on purpose labels!**

### Score Breakdown:

1. **User Role** (0-5 pts)
   - Faculty/Admin: 5 pts
   - PhD Student: 4 pts
   - Postgrad: 3 pts
   - Student: 2 pts

2. **Proof Verification** (0-12 pts) - **MOST IMPORTANT**
   - Faculty approval: 12 pts
   - Official letter: 10 pts
   - Department email: 9 pts
   - Event registration: 8 pts
   - Course syllabus: 7 pts
   - **NO PROOF for academic purpose: -5 pts penalty!**

3. **Description Details** (0-8 pts)
   - Specific dates mentioned: +1.5 pts
   - Faculty names (Dr./Prof.): +1.5 pts
   - Course codes: +1.5 pts
   - Venue details: +1.5 pts
   - Time mentions: +1.5 pts
   - **Generic phrases ("very important"): -2 pts**

### Anti-Gaming Examples:

**‚ùå Gaming Attempt:**
```
Purpose: "Exam"
Description: "Very important urgent exam"
Has proof: No
‚Üí Authenticity Score: 2 (role) + 0 (no details) - 5 (no proof for exam) = -3 ‚Üí 0/25
```

**‚úÖ Legitimate:**
```
Purpose: "Exam"
Description: "Mid-term exam for CSE301 Data Structures on March 15, 2pm-4pm, Dr. Kumar supervising, 45 students from Section A"
Has proof: Yes (Faculty approval)
‚Üí Authenticity Score: 2 + 12 + 7.5 = 21.5/25
```

## ‚è∞ Timing Scoring (15 points)

### Breakdown:

1. **Event Proximity** (0-8 pts)
   - ‚â§2 days: 8 pts
   - 3-7 days: 6 pts
   - 8-14 days: 4 pts
   - >14 days: 2 pts

2. **Urgency Label** (0-7 pts) - **Only if justified**
   - High: 7 pts (if description has urgency keywords)
   - Medium: 4 pts
   - Normal: 2 pts
   - **Unjustified urgency: √ó0.3 penalty**

### Example:

**‚ùå False Urgency:**
```
Urgency: High
Description: "Regular meeting"
Event date: 20 days away
‚Üí Timing Score: 2 (date) + 7√ó0.3 (unjustified) = 4.1/15
```

## ‚öñÔ∏è Fairness Scoring (10 points)

Starts at 10, penalties applied:

- **Cancellation rate >30%**: -3 pts
- **Cancellation rate >15%**: -1.5 pts
- **Consistently under-utilizing** (<50%): -2 pts
- **Pattern of high-count bookings** (>70%): -2 pts

## üö® Fraud Detection Flags

Each flag = **-5 points penalty**:

1. **GENERIC_DESCRIPTION**: Academic purpose with <30 chars
2. **NO_PROOF_ACADEMIC**: Exam/lecture/research without proof
3. **WASTEFUL_UTILIZATION**: <25% capacity used
4. **KEYWORD_STUFFING**: ‚â•3 urgency keywords in <50 chars
5. **REPETITIVE_CLAIMS**: "Important" or "urgent" repeated >2 times
6. **CAPACITY_EXCEEDED**: >120% capacity (auto-reject)

## üìà Acceptance Criteria

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Score ‚â• 50/100
- Utilization ‚â§ 105%

**Auto-Approval:**
- Score ‚â• 65 + No conflicts

**Priority Override:**
- If conflict exists, new request must score 15+ points higher

## üéØ How to Get High Score

### ‚úÖ DO:
1. **Match participants to capacity** (85-100% ideal)
2. **Provide proof** for academic purposes
3. **Add specific details**: dates, names, codes, venues
4. **Book appropriate size lab** for your group
5. **Be honest** about urgency

### ‚ùå DON'T:
1. ‚ùå Book 100-person lab for 10 people
2. ‚ùå Claim "exam" without faculty approval
3. ‚ùå Stuff description with "urgent important critical"
4. ‚ùå Use vague descriptions like "important meeting"
5. ‚ùå Mark high urgency for events 30 days away

Participants: 38
Purpose: Emergency
Description: "Emergency faculty meeting regarding curriculum changes, Dean's office notified, all CS faculty attending tomorrow 10am"
Has proof: Yes (Admin approval)
Urgency: High
Days until: 1

Scores:
- Capacity: 50/50 (95% utilization)
- Authenticity: 5 (faculty) + 12 + 6 = 23/25

- ‚ùå More participants = always higher score
- ‚ùå Purpose "exam" = instant high priority
- ‚ùå No capacity consideration
- ‚ùå Keyword-based (gameable)

### New System Fixes:
- ‚úÖ Capacity match is primary factor
- ‚úÖ Purpose labels require proof
- ‚úÖ Optimal utilization rewarded
- ‚úÖ Fraud detection built-in
